# Batch Script to Stop Oracle Services

This batch script allows you to stop Oracle services on a Windows system. It's useful when you need to manually stop Oracle services, for example, before system maintenance or an update or when you use Apache Tomcat Server.

## Usage

1. Download the `stop_oracle.bat` file to your system.
2. Double-click the `stop_oracle.bat` file to run it.
3. The script will execute and display a message indicating that it's stopping the Oracle services.
4. Once the services are stopped, the script will display a message indicating that the services have been stopped successfully.
5. Press any key to close the command window.

## Note

This script needs to be run as an administrator in order to stop the Oracle services. If you encounter issues running the script, make sure to open a command window with administrative privileges and run the script from there.
